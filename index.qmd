::: {#about}
My research interests broadly focus on health disparities, the social construction of disease, and the relationship between physical and mental health outcomes. My dissertation seeks to better understand the long-term mental and physical health effects of a weight-centric health paradigm through the mechanism of dieting for weight-loss and/or weight-maintenance.
